     Additional information from dmidecode follows.  WARNING: Use caution when you interpret
     this section. The 'dmidecode' program reads system data which is "intended to allow
     hardware to be accurately determined", but the intent may not be met, as there are
     frequent changes to hardware, firmware, and the "DMTF SMBIOS" standard.
